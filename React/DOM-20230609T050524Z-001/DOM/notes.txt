DOM (Document Object Model)

   DOM is an interface by the browser considering the
   document as a object model so that our programs can 
   manuplate(CRUD) the document.

   Dom tree will be created for every document , each 
   and every end points are called as NODES 

   ->If the node is a tag we call it as elemental node
     or Element.
   ->If the node is a text we call it as text node.
   ->If the node is a attribiute we call it as 
     attribiute node.
